    <p>If you're a fan of air fryers then this 
        air-fryer chicken recipes is for you. 
        If your air fryer is a two-drawer model, 
        cook the potato wedges and chicken in 
        separate drawers. If it’s a one-drawer 
        or lidded model, simply arrange the 
        chicken on top of the potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken drumsticks </li>
        <li>3 medium baking potatoes (about 600g), cut into 1.5cm wide wedges</li>
